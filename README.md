# LeetCode &middot; Solutions
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository!  
Here, you'll find my solutions to a range of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems, organized for easy reference.

> LeetCode is the best platform to help you enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interviews.

## Structure
This repository organizes LeetCode solutions into folders based on problem difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
Within each folder, solutions are named according to the problem title or ID and include files in multiple programming languages where applicable.

### Languages
Each problem folder includes one or more solution files.  
The table below lists the languages and corresponding file extensions used:

Language | File extension
--- | ---
C# | `.cs`
Python | `.py`
JavaScript | `.js`

## Getting started
To explore a solution:

1. Navigate to the relevant difficulty folder (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`).
2. Find the desired problem folder.
3. Open the file with the appropriate language extension.
